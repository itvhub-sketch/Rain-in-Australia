# Rain in Australia - Next-Day Prediction Model (Data Science)

## Project Overview

### Data Source

The data for this project was obtained from the Kaggle dataset titled *Rain in Australia*, which originates from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Daily Weather Observations. Further weather-related information for Australia is available through the bureau’s Climate Data Online web application.

### Business Problem

Weather, and our ability to predict it accurately, plays a vital role in numerous aspects of daily life. Whether it's farmers managing crops, families planning weekend getaways, or airlines making logistical decisions, rain is a key factor that can significantly affect plans. In some cases, rainfall can even lead to substantial financial implications. Consequently, a wide range of stakeholders have a vested interest in reliable rain forecasting. This project aims to develop a model that predicts whether it will rain the following day, using the provided dataset. Such a model could be integrated into a weather application to serve the general public.
